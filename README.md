### Future Features
As we continue to enhance the functionality and user experience of our application, we have identified several key features that will be implemented in future updates:
- User Roles
- Cursor Pagination
- Searching Functionality

### Last but not least

To facilitate a smoother testing process for our application, we will temporarily relax the password complexity requirements while retaining the confirmation password field. The confirmation password will still be saved in the database during this testing phase.
